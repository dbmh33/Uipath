  Characteristics identified as objectives for PDF/A were
       Device Independent - Can be reliably and consistently rendered without regard
        to the hardware or software platform
       Self-contained - Contains all resources necessary for rendering
       Self-documenting - Contains its own description
       Unfettered - Absence of technical file protection mechanisms
       Available - Authoritative specification publicly available
       Adoption - Widespread use may be the best deterrent against preservation risk

 (Standard: ISO 19005-1)

  Some useful PDF features work against, and are incompatible with,
   preserving information over the long-term
  PDF/A
  PDF Subset: restricted from using some PDF features, for example
       Anything that would alter the visual appearance over time (forms)
       No external references or embedded files
       Encryption
  PDF Subset: required to use some PDF features, for example
       Accessibility features for recoverable text (tagged PDF)
       Embed all fonts
       Specific metadata requirements
       Device independent color
